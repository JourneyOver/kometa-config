    summary: "Beneath the glossy image of corporate superheroes lies a brutal world of corruption, power, and unchecked destruction. As a few determined vigilantes take on the might of superpowered elites, the fight for truth becomes a battle of grit, deception, and moral reckoning. From twisted origins to bloody showdowns, the line between hero and villain shatters in a world where power is the ultimate weapon."
