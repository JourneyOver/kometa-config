    summary: "In a world where the dead outnumber the living, survival is a constant struggle marked by heartbreak, relentless danger, and unexpected alliances. Diverse communities—from suburban enclaves to untamed territories—confront the collapse of society and the harsh realities of a post-apocalyptic life. This interconnected universe explores the depths of human resilience and the enduring hope that persists even in the darkest times."
