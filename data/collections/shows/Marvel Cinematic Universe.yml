    summary: "From the shadows of covert operations to the farthest reaches of the multiverse, heroes rise to face impossible odds. Super soldiers, spies, street-level vigilantes, and cosmic beings each play their part in a vast, ever-expanding battle for justice. With alliances forged and destinies rewritten, every mission, every sacrifice, and every secret shapes a universe where the fight for hope is never truly over."
