    summary: "Some secrets are meant to stay buried. In this chilling reimagining of Stephen King's classic tale, a family's tragic loss leads them to an ancient burial ground with the power to bring back the deadâ€”but not without consequence. As unnatural forces take hold and sinister horrors rise from the grave, they soon discover that tampering with death comes at a terrifying cost."
