    summary: "In the vibrant metropolis of Zootopia, a city where every species struggles to coexist in a fragile balance, idealism collides with fear, ambition, and deeply rooted prejudice. As Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde navigate tangled mysteries and rising tensions, their growing trust becomes a powerful force against corruption, division, and social fracture. Heart, humor, and high-stakes adventure intertwine in a world where courage, empathy, and the fight for equality shape the future of an entire society."
