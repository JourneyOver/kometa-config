    summary: "A claustrophobic fight for survival unfolds beneath the ocean surface, where isolation, failing equipment, and unseen predators turn every breath into a risk. As characters descend into darker and more dangerous waters, panic and courage collide in a relentless struggle against time. Fear, resilience, and the instinct to survive define these deadly encounters in the deep."
