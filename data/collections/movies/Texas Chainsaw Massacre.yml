    summary: "Deep in the heart of Texas, a legacy of terror is born when a group of unsuspecting travelers stumbles upon a family with a taste for blood. What begins as a fight for survival becomes a decades-long nightmare fueled by madness, violence, and vengeance. From the haunting origins of Leatherface to the carnage that follows in his wake, every encounter is a brutal reminder that some horrors never dieâ€”they evolve, waiting for the next scream to echo through the darkness."
