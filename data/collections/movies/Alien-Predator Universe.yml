    summary: "Relentless xenomorphs. Unstoppable Predators. Human heroes pushed to their limits. Ripley's fight against the alien hive is a masterclass in resilience, facing terror head-on in the void of space. The Predators, driven by a code of honor, bring their lethal hunts to jungle battlefields and beyond. Claustrophobic corridors, unforgiving wilderness, and explosive clashes define the struggle for survival and dominance. Fear and courage collide in a relentless fight where only the strongest endure."
