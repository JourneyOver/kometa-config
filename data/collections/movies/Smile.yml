    summary: "In a world where a simple grin hides unspeakable terror, an unyielding force twists everyday life into a waking nightmare. A traumatic event unleashes unsettling visions and bone-chilling encounters, forcing those affected to face a sinister presence that transforms smiles into symbols of dread. With relentless tension and unexpected twists, every smile becomes a haunting reminder that fear may be closer than it appears."
