    summary: "Mischief and charm fill the countryside as a clever rabbit and his friends balance playful rebellion with the bonds of family. What begins as garden chaos grows into a journey of self-discovery, responsibility, and belonging beyond familiar fields. Humor, heart, and colorful adventure highlight the struggle between independence and knowing where one truly belongs."
