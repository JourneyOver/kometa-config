    summary: "A cursed town shrouded in fog draws the lost and the desperate into a nightmare shaped by guilt, faith, and buried trauma. As shifting realities reveal monsters born from inner torment, the search for loved ones becomes a confrontation with personal sins and dark cult influence. Horror, symbolism, and psychological dread intertwine as Silent Hill exposes the price of unresolved pain."
