    summary: "Mischievous chipmunk brothers Alvin, Simon, and Theodore team up with their patient guardian Dave Seville in a whirlwind of high-pitched harmonies, wild antics, and unstoppable energy. From chaotic home life and school rivalries to island castaways and cross-country chases, their adventures burst with catchy tunes, unbreakable loyalty, and the joyful chaos of family, proving that music and togetherness can conquer any mess."
