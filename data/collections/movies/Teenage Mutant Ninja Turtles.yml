    summary: "Raised in the shadows of the city, four unlikely brothers emerge to protect a world that barely knows they exist. Guided by loyalty, humor, and hard fought lessons, they face ruthless enemies, dangerous experiments, and threats that test their bond as a family. Through teamwork and heart, they learn that being heroes means standing together, no matter how strange the odds."
