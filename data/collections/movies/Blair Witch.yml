    summary: "What begins as a search for the truth behind an urban legend descends into a nightmarish journey of paranoia and terror. Lost in the deep, foreboding woods, those who seek answers are met with eerie whispers, unseen forces, and a presence that feeds on fear. As reality unravels and the darkness closes in, escape may be nothing more than a cruel illusion."
