    summary: "Haunted legacies, supernatural dread, and the fragile line between sanity and madness define these unsettling narratives. In an isolated, ominous hotel, a family's unraveling becomes a crucible for fear and mysterious powers. Years later, a man burdened by extraordinary gifts faces the echo of that terror, confronting forces that prey on vulnerability. Together, these tales evoke a chilling atmosphere of tension and emotional complexity, exploring how past shadows can shape—and challenge—the human spirit."
