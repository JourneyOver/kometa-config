    summary: "In the desolate wastelands of the American desert, unsuspecting travelers become the prey of a brutal and deformed clan lurking in the hills. As isolation turns to terror, survival becomes a savage struggle against relentless horrors born of radiation and revenge. The scorching sun hides no mercy, and every shadow conceals a new nightmare waiting to strike."
