    summary: "In the brutal final days of World War II, a solitary survivor with unbreakable resolve crosses paths with merciless enemies who underestimate what it means to take everything from a man who has nothing left to lose. What begins as a fight for survival becomes a relentless pursuit of vengeance, where endurance, grit, and an iron will turn the road itself into a battlefield."
