    summary: "A high-energy mix of live action and animation where basketball becomes the battleground for pride, freedom, and family. From a superstar pulled into a cartoon world to a new generation facing digital control and identity, familiar Looney Tunes chaos fuels epic games against overwhelming odds. Humor, spectacle, and heart collide as teamwork, self-belief, and the joy of play shape victories both on and off the court."
